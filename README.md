## TABLE OF CONTENTS

## GETTING STARTED

Remove all of the .tmp files in the ./res, ./docs, ./app/images, and ./app/fonts folders. These are there so that git will recognize the folder as having content, thus adding it to the commit.

The docs forlder is for deplying to gh-pages, if you are deploying to a different platform, feel free to delete the folder or rename it. Just make sure to change the parcel output directory in the package.json to the your preferred name.
